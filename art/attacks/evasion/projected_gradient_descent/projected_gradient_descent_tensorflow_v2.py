This module implements the Projected Gradient Descent attack `ProjectedGradientDescent` as an iterative method in which,
after each iteration, the perturbation is projected on a lp-ball of specified radius (in addition to clipping the
values of the adversarial sample so that it lies in the permitted data range). This is the attack proposed by Madry et
al. for adversarial training.

                     Currently, when `p` is not infinity, the projection step only rescales the noise, which may be

                           suggests this for FGSM based training to generalize across different epsilons. eps_step is
                           modified to preserve the ratio of eps / eps_step. The effectiveness of this method with PGD
