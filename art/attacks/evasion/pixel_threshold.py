    """Finds the global minimum of a multivariate function.
    Differential Evolution is stochastic in nature (does not use gradient
    methods) to find the minimium, and can search large areas of candidate
    space, but often requires larger numbers of function evaluations than
    conventional gradient based techniques.
    The algorithm is due to Storn and Price [1]_.
    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The objective function to be minimized.  Must be in the form
        ``f(x, *args)``, where ``x`` is the argument in the form of a 1-D array
        and ``args`` is a  tuple of any additional fixed parameters needed to
        completely specify the function.
    bounds : sequence
        Bounds for variables.  ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``,
        defining the lower and upper bounds for the optimizing argument of
        `func`. It is required to have ``len(bounds) == len(x)``.
        ``len(bounds)`` is used to determine the number of parameters in ``x``.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any additional fixed parameters needed to
        completely specify the objective function.
    strategy : str, optional
        The differential evolution strategy to use. Should be one of:
            - 'best1bin'
            - 'best1exp'
            - 'rand1exp'
            - 'randtobest1exp'
            - 'currenttobest1exp'
            - 'best2exp'
            - 'rand2exp'
            - 'randtobest1bin'
            - 'currenttobest1bin'
            - 'best2bin'
            - 'rand2bin'
            - 'rand1bin'
        The default is 'best1bin'.
    maxiter : int, optional
        The maximum number of generations over which the entire population is
        evolved. The maximum number of function evaluations (with no polishing)
        is: ``(maxiter + 1) * popsize * len(x)``
    popsize : int, optional
        A multiplier for setting the total population size.  The population has
        ``popsize * len(x)`` individuals (unless the initial population is
        supplied via the `init` keyword).
    tol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for convergence, the solving stops when
        ``np.std(pop) <= atol + tol * np.abs(np.mean(population_energies))``,
        where and `atol` and `tol` are the absolute and relative tolerance
        respectively.
    mutation : float or tuple(float, float), optional
        The mutation constant. In the literature this is also known as
        differential weight, being denoted by F.
        If specified as a float it should be in the range [0, 2].
        If specified as a tuple ``(min, max)`` dithering is employed. Dithering
        randomly changes the mutation constant on a generation by generation
        basis. The mutation constant for that generation is taken from
        ``U[min, max)``. Dithering can help speed convergence significantly.
        Increasing the mutation constant increases the search radius, but will
        slow down convergence.
    recombination : float, optional
        The recombination constant, should be in the range [0, 1]. In the
        literature this is also known as the crossover probability, being
        denoted by CR. Increasing this value allows a larger number of mutants
        to progress into the next generation, but at the risk of population
        stability.
    seed : int or `np.random.RandomState`, optional
        If `seed` is not specified the `np.RandomState` singleton is used.
        If `seed` is an int, a new `np.random.RandomState` instance is used,
        seeded with seed.
        If `seed` is already a `np.random.RandomState instance`, then that
        `np.random.RandomState` instance is used.
        Specify `seed` for repeatable minimizations.
    disp : bool, optional
        Display status messages
    callback : callable, `callback(xk, convergence=val)`, optional
        A function to follow the progress of the minimization. ``xk`` is
        the current value of ``x0``. ``val`` represents the fractional
        value of the population convergence.  When ``val`` is greater than one
        the function halts. If callback returns `True`, then the minimization
        is halted (any polishing is still carried out).
    polish : bool, optional
        If True (default), then `scipy.optimize.minimize` with the `L-BFGS-B`
        method is used to polish the best population member at the end, which
        can improve the minimization slightly.
    init : str or array-like, optional
        Specify which type of population initialization is performed. Should be
        one of:
            - 'latinhypercube'
            - 'random'
            - array specifying the initial population. The array should have
              shape ``(M, len(x))``, where len(x) is the number of parameters.
              `init` is clipped to `bounds` before use.
        The default is 'latinhypercube'. Latin Hypercube sampling tries to
        maximize coverage of the available parameter space. 'random'
        initializes the population randomly - this has the drawback that
        clustering can occur, preventing the whole of parameter space being
        covered. Use of an array to specify a population subset could be used,
        for example, to create a tight bunch of initial guesses in an location
        where the solution is known to exist, thereby reducing time for
        convergence.
    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for convergence, the solving stops when
        ``np.std(pop) <= atol + tol * np.abs(np.mean(population_energies))``,
        where and `atol` and `tol` are the absolute and relative tolerance
        respectively.
    Returns
    -------
    res : OptimizeResult
        The optimization result represented as a `OptimizeResult` object.
        Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
        Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully and
        ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
        `OptimizeResult` for a description of other attributes.  If `polish`
        was employed, and a lower minimum was obtained by the polishing, then
        OptimizeResult also contains the ``jac`` attribute.
    Notes
    -----
    Differential evolution is a stochastic population based method that is
    useful for global optimization problems. At each pass through the
    population the algorithm mutates each candidate solution by mixing with
    other candidate solutions to create a trial candidate. There are several
    strategies [2]_ for creating trial candidates, which suit some problems
    more than others. The 'best1bin' strategy is a good starting point for many
    systems. In this strategy two members of the population are randomly
    chosen. Their difference is used to mutate the best member (the `best` in
    `best1bin`), :math:`b_0`,
    so far:
    .. math::
        b' = b_0 + mutation * (population[rand0] - population[rand1])
    A trial vector is then constructed. Starting with a randomly chosen 'i'th
    parameter the trial is sequentially filled (in modulo) with parameters from
    `b'` or the original candidate. The choice of whether to use `b'` or the
    original candidate is made with a binomial distribution (the 'bin' in
    'best1bin') - a random number in [0, 1) is generated.  If this number is
    less than the `recombination` constant then the parameter is loaded from
    `b'`, otherwise it is loaded from the original candidate.  The final
    parameter is always loaded from `b'`.  Once the trial candidate is built
    its fitness is assessed. If the trial is better than the original candidate
    then it takes its place. If it is also better than the best overall
    candidate it also replaces that.
    To improve your chances of finding a global minimum use higher `popsize`
    values, with higher `mutation` and (dithering), but lower `recombination`
    values. This has the effect of widening the search radius, but slowing
    convergence.

    Examples
    --------
    Let us consider the problem of minimizing the Rosenbrock function. This
    function is implemented in `rosen` in `scipy.optimize`.
    >>> from scipy.optimize import rosen, differential_evolution
    >>> bounds = [(0,2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2)]
    >>> result = differential_evolution(rosen, bounds)
    >>> result.x, result.fun
    (array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), 1.9216496320061384e-19)
    Next find the minimum of the Ackley function
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization).
    >>> from scipy.optimize import differential_evolution
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> def ackley(x):
    ...     arg1 = -0.2 * np.sqrt(0.5 * (x[0] ** 2 + x[1] ** 2))
    ...     arg2 = 0.5 * (np.cos(2. * np.pi * x[0]) + np.cos(2. * np.pi *x[1]))
    ...     return -20. * np.exp(arg1) - np.exp(arg2) + 20. + np.e
    >>> bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]
    >>> result = differential_evolution(ackley, bounds)
    >>> result.x, result.fun

        clustering can occur, preventing the whole of parameter space being
        covered. Use of an array to specify a population could be used, for
        example, to create a tight bunch of initial guesses in an location
        where the solution is known to exist, thereby reducing time for
        convergence.
